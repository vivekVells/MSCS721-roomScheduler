# RoomScheduler
Simple console menu driven room scheduler framework.

This overly simple, intentially uncommented, and buggy room scheduler is intended to be used as an extendable framework for testing class assignments.

## My Role
### Task 0
Complete these objectives:
* Add the ability to import and export the meeting, room, and schedule data to JSON a file
or files, so that one can save and restore data entered from each program execution.
* Harden and enhance the program to handle errors so that the program will not crash or
fail, no matter what the user does. “Make the program idiot proof.”
* Add conflict checking to scheduling a room.
* Add comments using Javadoc tools and guidelines
